      <h1>HOW TO PLAY CHESSLESHIP!</h1>
      <h2>AIM</h2>
      <p>
        The aim of Chessleship is to uncover all the hidden pieces with the
        least amount of squares guessed.<br /><br />
      </p>
      <h2>Guesses and Turns</h2>
      <p>
        You have a maximum of 8 turns to reveal all the pieces, and want to use
        as few guesses as possible across those turns.<br /><br />
        Each turn, you can guess up to 8 squares by selecting them with
        mouse/touch. The less squares you guess, the better your score will
        be. You can deselect a selected square by pressing it again. <br />
        To end your turn, press the 'Guess' button. <br /><br>
        You can flag a square by right clicking (long press on mobile) on it to
        cycle through the pieces. <br />
        Flagging can be useful for keeping track of where pieces may be.<br><br />
      </p>
      <h2>Board Information</h2>
      <p>After you guess specific squares, information about the board state is revealed through different coloured squares:<br><br>
        Black Squares - this square is empty and is not being targeted by any pieces<br><br>
        Red Squares - congratulations! You have revealed one of the pieces. It has ceased being active and targeting other squares.<br><br>
        Yellow Squares - the square is empty but is being targeted by the number of active pieces displayed on the square. <br>
        As pieces are revealed and 'taken off the board', the number of active pieces targeting a square may decrease.<br><br>
        <h2>Additional Information</h2>
        <p>If you fail to reveal all the pieces within 8 turns, 32 will be added to your score (number of guesses taken).<br>
          This means you have to weigh up getting a lower score by guessing less pieces per turn, and increasing your risk of not revealing all the piece in time and losing.<br>
          Note: pieces can target squares through other pieces, and can target each other (however information on the number of pieces targeting an occupied cell is not available)</p>
