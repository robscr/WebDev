## Guidance for using Git from VSCode
The following commands at each step can be run in the terminal on VSCode. For it to work, ensure that your terminal is in the working directory of the repository. For me this is C:\Users\Patrick\Documents\GitHub\WebDev and yours will probably be something similar.

1. Ensure that you are in the desired branch.
   Use: **git checkout [branch name]**

   ("branch name" is just the name of the branch you want to work in, for example main or rob)

2. Make your changes in the desired documents

3. You can then add these changes.
   Use: **git add --all**

4. Commit these changes (to your local copy of the repository)
   Use: **git commit -m "commit_message_here"**

5. Push these commits from your branch on your local copy of the repository up to the repository stored on GitHub
   Use: **git push**
